  abstract = {There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics
	(the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal
	equilibrium at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial
	optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on
	many parameters). A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides
	a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and
	complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes
	new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional
	optimization problems and methods.},
